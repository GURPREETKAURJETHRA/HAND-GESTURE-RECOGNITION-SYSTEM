# HAND-GESTURE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM
Make a Smart TV system which can control the TV with userâ€™s hand gestures as the remote control

## Problem Statement

A smart tv manufactures wants to add gesture based controls to their TVs. 

To start with, the following 5 gestures are planned to be undstood by the TV:
- Thumbs Up to increase volume
- Thumbs Down to decrease volume
- Left Swipe to move 10 seconds back
- Right Swipe to move 10 seconds ahead
- Open Palm (Stop) to pause

The hardware and software to capture and take action based on the gestures already exists with the manufacturer, our focus will be on `Recognising the Gestures`.

We used a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize hand gestures. The model was trained on a large dataset of hand gestures and was fine-tuned on our custom dataset. The project was successfully able to recognize a variety of hand gestures including thumb-up, thumb-down, fist, and peace sign. It has the potential to be used in various applications such as sign language recognition, gaming, and virtual reality.

## Data
- The data we have been provided with to train our model consists of images / frames taken in a sequence (videos that are already broken down into images) for various individuals showing the above mentioned hand gestures.  
- The data is labelled with the different classes (gestures) that need to be identified.

## Approach
To do this, we will be using `Deep Learning`. Specifically, we will be trying two approaches:
- Approach 1: 3D CNN Model  
- Approach 2: A CNN + RNN Model
